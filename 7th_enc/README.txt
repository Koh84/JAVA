//Encapsulation stops user from accessing variable of class i.e age directly.
//It can be achieved by using public int setAge(int age) and getAge(), 
//age must be defined with private
//private - can only be access in class
//default - can only be accessed in the same package name
//protected - can be access in package and other son classes
//public - everyone can use in this file
